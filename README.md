# Pokemon-Infinity
A Pokemon game attempting to use procedural generation to build the world.

### TODO (basically things I've thought of that I can probably get done in time.)
Random generation (grass and towns)

PokeCenter (at least the tiles. probably not inside)

Overworld map

Simple battles (maybe something like Let's Go?)

Walking animations

Music and sound effects

Pokeball GUI (grayed out Pokeballs when no pokemon in that slot)

Stretch: Multiplayer lol probably not
